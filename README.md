### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Hello World !
I am a beginner programmer from Polish. I started my adventure a little over a year ago by learning HTML and CSS, then step by step I entered this world :-). On my way, I met LESS and SASS preprocessors and all the surrounding elements associated with them. From programming languages, I learned JavaScript and Python. I know I still have a long way to go, but I KNOW I'm READY for it! :-)
